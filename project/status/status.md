Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Created the main.lua file, as well as several objects. Basic functionality works; the staff and notes scroll at the appropriate speed, the response area has been created, and the game's
appearance looks fine.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Add music; make notes responsive; start and end states.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Nothing much that can't be solved with a Google search.
