## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

An iOS app that allows the student to either enter the materials of an item or point the camera at an item and it will tell you whether it is recyclable, compostable, or trash.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

Student: Sergio Jara-Reynoso
Section Leader: Julian

## Do you have any questions of your own?

How do you program to use the camera and also how to use images to compare?
Would this be too difficult of an app?
