# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Scorebeat

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A rhythm game that revolves around hitting notes along a sheet of music.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This game will be much like other popular rhythm games, such as Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. However, instead of hitting circles or arrows, the player must hit notes on
a continuously scrolling sheet of music. As the score scrolls across the screen, the player must hit the notes as they approach the left side of the screen until the song is over. As
of now, I'm unsure as to whether the input should be via mouse or keyboard, or whether the game will have a mobile version. Ideally, the game will have features such as a high score
tracker and multiple songs as well.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- Basic functionality (working player input, audio, clean interface, etc.)
- At least one short song finished to completion
- Score display at the end of the song

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- At least two songs
- A high score tracker
- Customizable UI

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Multiple difficulty levels
- At least three full-length songs
- Mobile compatibility

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to find a program and programming language that will best suit my needs. I will also have to research how to best implement sounds into the game, since that will be
a vital part of the game. I will also have to find songs to use, and eventually I may have to research how to port the game to different devices.
